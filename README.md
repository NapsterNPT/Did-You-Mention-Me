## No more worries about someone calling you when you are AFK.

This will make a notification sound whenever someone says your nickname and the Minecraft window isn't in focus mode.

You can download the mod from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/did-you-mention-me) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NapsterNPT/Did-You-Mention-Me/releases/tag/Release); any other source will be marked as unofficial.

### Future update:
- More compatibility with "mod menu".
- Settings menu.
    - Sound setting
    - Name setting
